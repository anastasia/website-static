**Animated restroom sign** &mdash; The men's bathroom had the best sign ever! I've never been so delighted by a bathroom sign. Playful and fun use of a projector and an animation.

**[Interface I](http://www.rlfbckr.org/work/interface-i) by Ralf Baecker** &mdash; A red horizontal line is adjusted up and down the vertical axis to make a fluid line graph irl. The horizontal line seems to be controlled by hundreds of little motors moving thin clear cable up and down. Gorgeously lit and placed in a large dark room.

**Single Stroke Structures by Takahiro Hasegawa and Yasuaki Kakehi** &mdash; make temporary structures (maybe even phone booths!?!) out of strategically crimped, inflated plastic tubing. How amazing would it be to keep a shed in your backpack?

**[Highlight](http://highlight.digital.udk-berlin.de/) by Jussi Ängeslavä, Michael Burk, Iohanna Nicenboim** &mdash; direct light using a lampshade. 3D printing allows for the matching of shade with the room &mdash; direct light where you want it.

**Photosynth printing** &mdash; print on plants. Mask the leaf and expose the rest to light that causes alters the photosynth process.
