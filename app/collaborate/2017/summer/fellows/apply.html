      <h2>The Program</h2>
      <div class="slice-body">
        <p>A cohort of five to seven fellows will join the Lab in June 2017 and will stay through August 2017. Fellows will enter the program with their own projects and will collaborate with their cohort and members of the Lab to produce paradigm-shifting research, design, code, and art. Have a look at the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/collaborate/2016/summer/fellows/">phenomenal work of the 2016 summer cohort</a>.</p>

        <p>Energy from all corners of law, tech, and libraries is welcomed, with particular encouragement given to potential candidates that might benefit from some of the Lab's current work in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/caselaw-access-project/">open law</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/perma-cc">web archives</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/nuremberg-project/">war crimes research</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2016/09/02/private-talking-spaces-progress/">private talking spaces</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/sketches/canifairuse-it">crowdsourced fair use predictions</a>, and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/h2o/">free textbooks</a>. All stages of education and career are welcome &mdash; from drifters to undergraduates to practicing artists to working professionals.</p>

        <p>Fellows will have access to working space in the Harvard Law School Library and will lead weekly research and project updates on Wednesdays. The structure over the ten weeks will be largely shaped by the work of the fellows and the energy they contribute.</p>

      <h2>Benefits</h2>
      <div class="slice-body">
        <p>The Lab is a gathering place for ideas. It brings together creative thinkers to solve problems, and has a culture that encourages a bias for action. We think and we do. The Lab's tendency to push individuals and groups toward meaningful work is the greatest benefit of the program.</p>

        <p>In addition to a rich environment, fellows will receive access to Harvardâ€™s world class research libraries and collaboration opportunites with the staff, faculty, and researchers in the Lab and in the <a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a>.</p>

        <p>Each fellow will receive a stipend of $6,000 that we hope will defray some of the housing, transportation, and child care costs that each fellow will incur.</p>

      <h2>Diversity</h2>
      <div class="slice-body">
        <p>The work and well-being of the Lab are strengthened profoundly by the diversity of our network and our differences in background, culture, experience, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and much more. We actively seek and welcome applications from people of color, women, the LGBTQIA community, and persons with disabilities, as well as applications from researchers and practitioners from across the spectrum of disciplines and methods.</p>

      <div class="slice-body">
        <p>The deadline for 2017 applications has passed, but watch this space and follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/harvardlil">Twitter</a> for information about our 2018 program! Coming January 2018.</p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <div class="slice-body">
        <p><strong>Do I have to live in Cambridge, MA?</strong></p>

        <p>All fellows are expected to be in Langdell Hall on Wednesdays and we hope fellows will collaborate in-person throughout the week. Close proximity collaboration is one of the central benefits of the program.</p>

        <p><strong>Any insider tips on housing for the summer?</strong></p>

        <p>Boston hosts tons of students that are not around during the summer. Ask your network and spend some time on <a href="http://boston.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a> to get a feel for options. Another spot you might want to check out is the College for Social Innovation, which <a href="http://collegeforsocialinnovation.org/summerhousing/#">rents</a> out furnished student housing for the summer.</p>

        <p><strong>What are the dates of the program?</strong></p>

        <p>The program will start on Monday, June 5, 2017 and run through Friday, August 11, 2017.</p>

        <p><strong>Can I apply from outside the United States?</strong></p>

        <p>Absolutely. A broad range of backgrounds and ways of thinking are highly valued.</p>

        <p><strong>When do I hear from you? What is the timeframe for decisions?</strong></p>

        <p>Applications are due by Friday, February 10, 2017. You will receive notice of acceptance by the end of March 2017.</p>
