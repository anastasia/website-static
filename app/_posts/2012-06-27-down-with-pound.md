LIL offices are located in Langdell Hall, about 20 feet away from Pound Hall. Part of Pound Hall is currently being jackhammered and bulldozed to make way for [a new outdoor common space](http://www.construction.harvard.edu/law-school/Pound%20Hall/index.html). Here's a snapshot of what we see when we enter Langdell.
